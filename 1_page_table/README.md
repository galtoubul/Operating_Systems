The goal in this assignment is to implement simulated OS code that handles a multi-level (trie-based)
page table. You will implement two functions. The first function creates/destroys virtual memory
mappings in a page table. The second function checks if an address is mapped in a page table. (The
second function is needed if the OS wants to igure out which physical address a process virtual
address maps to.)
