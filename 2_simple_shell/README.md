The goal of this assignment is to gain experience with process management, pipes, signals, and the
relevant system calls. To do this, you will implement a simple shell program. You will implement
the function that receives a shell command and performs it. We provide a skeleton shell program
(shell.c), which reads lines from the user, parses them into commands, and invokes your function.
You also have to implement any initialization/finalization code that you require.
